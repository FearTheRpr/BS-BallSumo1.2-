1) Inside Unity, open the Window menu and select 'World Creator to Unity' to open the World Creator Unity Bridge window.

2) Select the proper Bridge.xml file located in [USER]/Documents/WorldCreator/Bridge/[PROJECT_NAME]. 

3) Apply the settings of your choice and press SYNCHRONIZE to the bottom of the World Creator to Unity Bridge window.

4) Enjoy :)



IMPORTANT:

This version of the Unity Bridge works with the Standalone version 2.3.0f1 (and above) of World Creator release on 5th September 2020. 

If you have used colored textures and gradients inside World Creator, please make sure you are using version 2.3.0f1 of World Creator 
to properly export to this version of the Unity Bridge. Else, colored textures and gradients will have no effect on the terrain created
by this Unity Bridge (you will see the default applied texture without additional color shading).
